# Paper-Grading-System
The Paper Grading System is a web-based tool for automatic assessment of student answers. Teachers upload model answers, students upload their responses, and the system processes them (via Python script) to grade correctness. It features dashboards for both teacher &amp; student, with secure uploads and grade feedback.
